# Contributing to LocalAI-Deployment POC

Thanks for wanting to help! This repo is a simple, zero-cost local AI agent setup for POCs and SMEs in SA — no cloud bills, works offline during loadshedding.

We want your contributions — big or small.

### What we need help with
- Better/faster models (Phi-3-mini, Qwen2.5-7B, etc.)
- OpenClaw integration tweaks
- SA-specific configs (e.g. loadshedding battery/UPS tips)
- Performance benchmarks on different hardware
- Web UI options (OpenWebUI, chat scripts)
- README improvements, screenshots, videos
- Bug fixes, security hardening

### How to contribute
1. Fork the repo  
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-cool-change`  
3. Make your changes  
4. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m "Add Phi-3-mini as faster alternative"`  
5. Push: `git push origin feature/my-cool-change`  
6. Open a Pull Request — describe what you changed and why

No perfect code required — even typos in README or new model YAMLs are welcome.
